# Spring Batch Practice

## Introduction
* Practice the Spring Batch, following the steps in [spring academy](https://spring.academy/courses/building-a-batch-application-with-spring-batch).
* Practice flyway

> ! If you want to run the project please manually create table, do not depends on flyway.  
> I think the execution stage of batch and flyway gets a conflict, i got the errors like the jobRepository can't find a table with the name batch_job_execution.
